- **_Warning: the modid has been renamed from gregtech to gti, so some stuff in world may break. I managed to remap blocks and items, but machines will still lose stuff inside them and such. therefore I reccomend picking up all machines and pipes. Make sure to backup your worlds before loading this._**
- Textures have changed to more match original gt5u, though the base textures are still colored
- Bunch of recipes have been changed/added, not really sure what all has been done
- changed 9x battery buffer to 8x
- added 16x battery buffer
- added more fluid slots to electrolyzer and centrifuge
- See commit history on github for a more info on what changed
- Note: on servers you have to run the server twice the very first time you add this mod, or drag out a jar from inside gti in the META-INF/jars folder
